# spot-tactics

TODO:
- Generate a test file for tactics recongizer
- Modify pin find logic to recognize relative pins
- Add test for fork detection via xrays


OBSERVATIONS:

Fork logic didnt' consider forks done by king
Hanging pieces doesn't consider pieces that can be exchanged for gain of material
Pin logic only considers absolute pins to the king
